### Step 1: Initialize Next.js App Router Structure
⏱️ ~20 minutes | 🎯 Learning: Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript configuration

**What you'll learn**: How Next.js projects are organized, App Router vs Pages
Router, TypeScript strict mode benefits, and why this structure supports
development and deployment.

**Say to Claude Code**:
```
Set up the Next.js 15 App Router structure with TypeScript as specified in
claude.md. Include app/layout.tsx, app/page.tsx, and core configuration files.
Please explain the purpose of each major file as you create them.
```

**What will be created**:

- app/page.tsx (landing page)
- app/globals.css (Tailwind directives)

**Verification**:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000 - should see default landing page
```

**Before moving to Step 2**: Review the generated files. Notice:
- How layout.tsx wraps all pages
- TypeScript strict mode catches errors early
- Tailwind configuration uses CSS variables for theming

---

### Step 2: Configure Supabase Client

- app/dashboard/page.tsx (protected route example)
- components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx
- components/auth/LoginForm.tsx
- components/auth/SignupForm.tsx
- lib/auth/actions.ts (server actions for auth)

**Verification**:
- Visit /auth/signup - create account
- Check Supabase dashboard - user should appear
- Visit /dashboard - should redirect to login if not authenticated
- Login - should access dashboard

---

### Step 4: Create Recipe CRUD Feature
⏱️ ~45 minutes | 🎯 Learning: Full-stack data flow, Server Actions, form handling

**What you'll learn**: How data flows from UI → Server Action → Database and back,
form validation, error handling, and TypeScript types for database models.

**Say to Claude Code**:
```

Include form validation, error handling, optimistic updates, and TypeScript
types. Show me the full data flow.
```

**What will be created**:
- app/recipes/page.tsx (recipe list)
- app/recipes/new/page.tsx (create recipe)
- app/recipes/[id]/page.tsx (view recipe)
- app/recipes/[id]/edit/page.tsx (edit recipe)
- components/recipes/RecipeForm.tsx
- components/recipes/RecipeCard.tsx
- lib/recipes/actions.ts (Server Actions)
- lib/recipes/queries.ts (database queries)
- lib/recipes/types.ts (TypeScript types)
- Database migration file

**Verification**:
- Run migration to create recipes table
- Visit /recipes/new - create a recipe
- View recipe list - should display your recipe
- Edit and delete - should work
- Check Supabase - data should persist

---

### Step 5: Add Image Upload for Recipes
⏱️ ~30 minutes | 🎯 Learning: File uploads, Supabase Storage, image optimization

**What you'll learn**: File upload patterns, image optimization with Next.js,
Supabase Storage buckets, and signed URLs for security.

**Say to Claude Code**:
```
Add image upload functionality to recipes using Supabase Storage. Include image
preview, validation (size, type), and optimization. Explain the security model
for file access.
```

**What will be created**:
- lib/storage/upload.ts (upload utilities)
- lib/storage/config.ts (bucket configuration)
- components/recipes/ImageUpload.tsx
- Updated RecipeForm with image field
- Storage bucket setup instructions

**Verification**:
- Create Supabase Storage bucket (instructions provided)
- Upload image when creating recipe
- Image should display in recipe card
- Delete recipe - image should be removed from storage

---

### Step 6: Implement Recipe Search
⏱️ ~30 minutes | 🎯 Learning: Full-text search, debouncing, query optimization

**What you'll learn**: PostgreSQL full-text search, search input debouncing,
query performance optimization, and UX patterns for search.

- lib/recipes/search.ts (search queries)
- app/search/page.tsx (search results page)
- Database migration for search indexes

**Verification**:
- Type in search bar - should debounce
- Search for recipe title - should find matches
- Search for ingredient - should work
- Empty search - should show all recipes

---

### Step 7: Add Testing Suite
⏱️ ~30 minutes | 🎯 Learning: Testing strategies, test structure, mocking

**What you'll learn**: How to write effective tests for Next.js + Supabase apps,
when to use unit vs integration tests, and testing best practices.

## Comparison: Learning Mode vs Quick Start Mode

### Same Project, Different Modes

| Aspect | Learning Mode | Quick Start Mode |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Initial Files** | 7 files (foundation only) | 50+ files (complete scaffold) |
| **Time to First Code** | After Step 1 (~20 min) | Immediate (0 min) |
| **Understanding Level** | Deep (explained step-by-step) | Surface (must explore on own) |
| **Total Setup Time** | 4-7 hours (spread over days) | 15-30 minutes (all at once) |
| **Learning Value** | High - teaches each layer | Medium - learn by reading code |
| **Customization** | Easy - build as you go | Harder - must understand existing code |
| **Best For** | First 2-3 projects in stack | Experienced with stack |
| **Overwhelm Factor** | Low - incremental | High - everything at once |
| **Control** | High - you choose what to add | Medium - must remove what you don't want |

### When to Switch from Learning to Quick Start

You're ready for Quick Start Mode when:
- ✅ You've completed 2-3 projects in Learning Mode
- ✅ You recognize patterns from previous projects
- ✅ You can explain each layer's purpose
- ✅ You're confident debugging the stack
- ✅ Setup steps feel routine, not educational
